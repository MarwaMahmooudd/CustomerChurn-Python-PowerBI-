# Customer Churn (ML&PowerBI)
This project is related to the University Sains Malaysia and my MBA and Data Analytics graduation project.
## Project Overview
Churn rate is a marketing metric that describes the number of customers who leave a business over a specific period. Every user is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn at any given time. This value is based on:
1-User demographic information
2-Browsing behavior
3-Historical purchase data among other information
## Tools Used
### Python (ML)
1- Identifying at-risk customers in the context of customer churn by using machine learning algorithms to collect, clean, and organize datasets to build predictive models using customer datasets.
2- Using Power BI to create interactive dashboards that visualize customer expectations and insights.
3- Additional focus on improving employee retention rates and reporting in academic research.
