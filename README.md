# Customer Churn (ML&PowerBI)
This project is related to the University Sains Malaysia and my MBA and Data Analytics graduation project.
## Project Overview
Churn rate is a marketing metric that describes the number of customers who leave a business over a specific period. Every user is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn at any given time. This value is based on:
1-User demographic information
2-Browsing behavior
3-Historical purchase data among other information
## Tools Used
### Python (ML)
Identifying at-risk customers in the context of customer churn by using machine learning algorithms to collect, clean, and organize datasets to build predictive models using customer datasets such as LGBMClassifier, Logistic Regression, XGBClassifier, and XGBoost.
### Power BI
Using Power BI to create interactive dashboards that visualize customer expectations and insights.
